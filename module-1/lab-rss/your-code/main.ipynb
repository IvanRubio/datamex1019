Given that Amazon’s AWS Lambda functions are only five years old this November, anyone with more than three years of experience is a very early adopter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Approximately 30% of respondents have adopted serverless within the past year, and that is less than the over 50% who adopted serverless between one and three years ago. The gap may be due to respondents from major software companies and other technology-focused industries having explored serverless as an infrastructure option in its early days, and these organizations are historically faster to experiment with and adopt emerging paradigms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A related point: the rise of the serverless paradigm coincides with what we’ve referred to elsewhere as &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-is-next-architecture/\">Next Architecture</a>.&#8221; As the uncommitted respondents (again, 60%) grapple with issues surrounding the main components of Next Architecture—decomposition, containers, the cloud, and orchestration—serverless adoption would seem poised for considerable growth in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 6\" class=\"wp-image-9808\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 6.

Stories of serverless success can help motivate non-adopters to more intensely evaluate how serverless might fit their infrastructure needs—the early adopters blazing a trail for those in more cautious organizations. We expect growing momentum for serverless, even as the challenges associated with adoption become more clear.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666-1048x550.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 7\" class=\"wp-image-9809\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666-1048x550.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666-300x158.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666-768x403.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 7. Success rating of serverless adoption among survey respondents, broken down by serverless experience level.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The chart packs in a lot of data. A quick summary reveals that sophisticated respondents—i.e., those with three-plus years of serverless experience—show 79% mostly successful or better (17% extremely successful; 34% successful; 28% mostly successful); those early to serverless, i.e., with one-to-three years of experience, show 75% mostly successful or better (9% extremely successful; 32% successful, 34% mostly successful); and those new to the topic with less than a year of experience rate their implementations mostly successful or better 52% of the time (6% extremely successful, 29% successful, 17% mostly successful).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The contrast between organizations with the most and least time with serverless shows that experience appears to pay off. Serverless requires time and experience to resolve the tooling, data protection, and operational challenges that adopting serverless creates.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480-1048x613.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 8\" class=\"wp-image-9810\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480-1048x613.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480-300x176.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480-768x449.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 8. Serverless benefits among survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked about the benefits of adopting serverless, there were some stand-out issues. “Reduction of operational costs” was the No. 1 reported benefit. Rather than buying racks and racks of servers that need to handle the maximum potential traffic and be idle most of the time, it seems that serverless’ method of paying by compute is proving to be beneficial to the bottom lines of organizations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This likely goes hand-in-hand with the second most popular reason for adoption: “scales with demand automatically.” Instead of planning for average or maximum usage, you can deploy serverless and it will scale to current usage. You only pay for what is used. This scaling takes away the worry from random and unexpected traffic spikes or big seasonal traffic.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The third stand-out issue was “no server maintenance.” As noted earlier, the majority of survey respondents are software engineers. These are not system administrators whose job it is to worry about keeping software patched, secured, and managed. When those details are the responsibility of the serverless provider, a software engineer&#8217;s time is freed up to focus on a wider range of tasks and roles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173-1048x540.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 9\" class=\"wp-image-9811\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173-1048x540.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173-300x155.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173-768x396.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 9. Serverless benefits among survey respondents, broken down by serverless experience level.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we add experience level to the serverless benefit results (Figure 9), we see that “reduced engineering lead time” and “reduced development costs” were more significant benefits for companies that have been working with serverless for more than three years. This further reinforces that it takes time to start seeing significant cost benefits with serverless.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 10\" class=\"wp-image-9812\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 10. Serverless challenges faced by survey respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Educating current staff” was the No. 1 concern among respondents whose organizations have adopted serverless. That makes sense: with serverless being relatively young, formal training is difficult to find, specific documentation must be generated, and case studies to learn from—while growing—are harder to come by. In addition, organizations sometimes discover that success requires custom features. These features evolve quickly as vendors vigorously compete to attract and retain customers—making up-to-date formal training difficult to maintain.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The second biggest challenge was “vendor lock-in.” Writing code for one vendor platform does not make it portable or simple to move elsewhere. Because serverless is a nascent space, it seems the market is waiting to see how the issue of portability among vendors plays out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Integration/testing is harder” ranked as the third biggest worry, noted by 30% of respondents. Testing is more complex and labor intensive for serverless architectures, with more scenarios to address and different types of dependencies (e.g., latency, startup, mocking, etc.) changing the integration landscape—at least for now. We expect these testing issues to mostly resolve as serverless gains traction and new engineering practices that make testing easier emerge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The teams and tools that manage serverless</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 11\" class=\"wp-image-9813\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 11. Teams that manage serverless in survey respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DevOps and serverless seem a natural match, so it’s no surprise to see DevOps teams as the top choice among respondents for managing serverless implementations. Deploying containerized services on serverless architectures and orchestrating those services with Kubernetes fits into existing DeOps practices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That teams associated with software development hold the next three positions for managing serverless also makes sense. Serverless presents a conceptually simpler path to deploying software for those in development roles with no need to manage servers and storage. Not that serverless is simple: survey respondents note many challenges (see Figure 10), and those in software roles need to develop the chops required to deploy on serverless infrastructures—including knowing when those infrastructures are appropriate for their applications.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 12\" class=\"wp-image-9814\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 12. Serverless vendors used by survey respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The results in Figure 12 reflect what we know of the cloud market and mirror what we found in our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-companies-adopt-and-apply-cloud-native-infrastructure\">cloud native survey</a> from earlier in 2019. Amazon’s early-to-market serverless offering and dominant market position has given them a functional leg up on their primary rivals in the cloud market. However, both Microsoft and Google have ramped up their own serverless offerings and likely retain whatever market differentiation they’ve already developed in the wider cloud market—i.e., customers who already like and use Azure or Google Cloud Platform are likely to find the same advantages hold with Azure Functions and Google Cloud Functions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 13\" class=\"wp-image-9815\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 13. Serverless tools used by survey respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Custom tooling” ranked No. 1 in tools used. This could mean there’s a market for standardizing or improving existing tools, getting companies to either migrate away from their in-house tools, or to convince new customers to avoid spending the time to build something custom. It could also mean that current tools are not addressing everything needed to properly manage and deploy to serverless infrastructure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another thing to consider is that respondents had the option of checking all the tools that apply. Custom tooling could simply be a shell script or cron job that is unique to a build process, but starts a chain of existing tools provided by various vendors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Why companies haven&#8217;t adopted serverless</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure14-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 14\" class=\"wp-image-9816\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure14-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure14-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure14-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure14.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 14. Reasons why survey respondents’ organizations have not adopted serverless.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Turning to the 60% of respondents whose organizations have not adopted serverless (Figure 4), they cited “security concerns” as the chief reason they have avoided serverless. Because we’re in an environment where security is a paramount concern, the adoption of any new technology carries a lot of weight. Moreover, serverless introduces a different paradigm for data management where sensitive data is much more dynamic. With valuable business data not being managed or controlled by your company, there will always be concerns around who has access, how safe is it, whether or not the vendor looks at the data or metadata, and whether or not the software is patched or vulnerable to attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adjacent to security is also the challenge of meeting regulatory requirements like GDPR. In the cloud on third-party servers, can you guarantee the same levels of security and quality as your own on your own infrastructure?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 15\" class=\"wp-image-9817\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 15. When survey respondents expect their companies to implement serverless.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The high rate of survey participation shows the keen interest technologists have in the nascent, fast-moving ecosystem of serverless options, regardless of their own organization’s serverless plans. That respondents are paying close attention to serverless reflects a software architecture “best practice:” the need to understand every approach, even those that don’t apply.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The survey shows a cautious but curious world-wide cohort of engineers, tech leads, architects, and others from a variety of industries interested enough in serverless to respond to the survey. For the 40% who have taken the plunge into serverless adoption, we see that time and exposure bring success. And, those with the most serverless experience see that the promise of decreased costs, automatic scaling, and improved developer productivity holds as the top serverless benefits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet significant concerns exist, including training/upskilling existing staff, vendor lock-in, and the difficulties of integration and testing. Other factors blocking an embrace of serverless include concerns about security and managing this new type of infrastructure. And survey results show that these concerns do not go away even after adoption. It just seems that adopters have weighed the issues and determined the benefits of serverless adoption more than merit tolerating the drawbacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Based on the survey, we expect the demand for serverless to grow in the near term as another worthwhile infrastructure option for many organizations. With no ties to specific technologies or programming languages, serverless can work with a wide range of tasks, and getting started has gotten easier over time.</p>\\n\\n\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\\n<div id=\"_ftn1\">\\n<p><a href=\"#F1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The serverless adoption survey ran in June 2019.</p>\\n</div>\\n</aside><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Tpz60LEjmU4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

He describes the significance of a large project they&#8217;re wrapping up, move.mil. &#8220;Military service members have to move every two to four years, and the system that was enabling those moves was generally hostile toward the user experience. We&#8217;re working to use modern technologies to implement a new-and-improved system to schedule the moves to allow service members&#8217; spouses and family members to be active participants in figuring out how they&#8217;re going to uproot their lives and move across the country or around the world.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=2\">00:02</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>Recruiting is a challenge for any organization, but it&#8217;s particularly quirky for teams working with government organizations, Firth explains. He looks for folks who are not only at the top of their fields, but for those able to maneuver around the frustrations of slow-moving bureaucracy. &#8220;We have what we call core competencies&mdash;questions we ask and things we look for to determine whether or not someone&#8217;s going to be a good fit in our organization. &#8230; Some of those things that we call &#8217;emotional quotient&#8217; are as important if not more so than some of the technical quotient things we&#8217;re looking for. &#8230; We have to go through an enormous amount of validation of a person&#8217;s prior experiences, but then also a validation of them as a human. It gives us the ability to do the whole person concept, to make sure that, as we have a small team and we have to maintain a small team, we can work to make that small team work well together.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=57\">00:57</a>)\\n\\n<p>One might think it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult, Firth notes, but one of the main success metrics he uses is whether or not they can convince others that technology can make their lives better. Also in Firth&#8217;s case, the military leadership he deals with turns over every two to four years; all around, he&#8217;s on a &#8220;constant education campaign.&#8221; Firth outlines how he measures overall success: &#8220;Have we made the user&#8217;s life better? Have we used technology to do so in a way that appreciates (1) the capability of the technology, but also (2), the capability of the people who are implementing that technology and will have to do so long term? Then (3), have we walked away leaving behind us a legacy of creating that understanding of what technology could be used for?&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=198\">03:18</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/XeRPWuPwIDk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Until Bitcoin, Song argues, there was no decentralized scarcity in the digital realm. &#8220;Decentralized digital scarcity is a profound invention,&#8221; Song explains &#8220;because it lets you transfer value without an intermediary. There is no permission involved, there&#8217;s no censorability, and that makes it an excellent, excellent [form of] money.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=63\">1:03</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the tangible social impacts of Bitcoin can be witnessed in the human rights arena. As one example, Song offers an overview of the refugee crisis in Venezuela, explaining that Bitcoin is allowing those wishing to flee the country to sell their belongings and retain their money when crossing the border to Columbia. &#8220;There&#8217;s very clear evidence of this,&#8221; Song explains &#8220;because the price of Bitcoin in Columbia is actually lower than everywhere else in the world because there&#8217;s such a big supply. Four million Venezuelans have left. That&#8217;s 10% of their population. That&#8217;s a serious impact. Usually in refugee crises, it has gotten so bad that people were willing to leave everything behind. With this, they get to carry their wealth. It undermines the Maduro government to a large degree.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=351\">5:51</a>)</p> \\n\\n<p>The US&#8217;s market-driven monetary imperialism has led, Song argues, to a sort of global US dollar hegemony—the impact of which is that all global trade is settled in US dollars; if you&#8217;re in Kenya and want to trade with someone in neighboring Nigeria, you have to trade for the US dollar and then back to the Kenyan shilling. Song notes this basically gives the US dominance over everything and allows dictators, who control their economies through their central banks, to use money as a tool of oppression. &#8220;Bitcoin gives you a politically neutral money, one that&#8217;s not dominated by a single country. I say all this about the US dollar, but imagine a world where the Chinese yuan is the dominant currency.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=642\">10:42</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/ENi7moVeFTY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Is this just a natural evolution in the history of technology?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deepfakes are media that are created by AI. They appear to be genuine (e.g., a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/17/17247334/ai-fake-news-video-barack-obama-jordan-peele-buzzfeed\">video of President Obama</a>) but have limited connection to reality. An audio track can be created that sounds indistinguishable from the victim, saying something the victim would never have said. Video can be generated from existing videos or photos that match the soundtrack, so that the mouth moves correctly and the facial expressions look natural. It’s not surprising that humans have trouble detecting fakes; with the current technology, even shallow fakes are too good.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deepfakes are the logical extension of older AI research. It wasn’t long ago that we read about AI generating new paintings in the style of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053520/ai-just-3d-printed-a-brand-new-rembrandt-and-its-shockingly-good.html\">Rembrandt</a> and other Dutch Masters, stylizing pictures in the style of <a href=\"https://qz.com/495614/computers-can-now-paint-like-van-gogh-and-picasso/\">Van Gogh and Picasso</a>, and so on. At the time, there was more concern about the future of human creativity: would we still need artists? Would we live in a world full of fake Van Goghs? We shrugged those “fakes” off because we were asking the wrong questions. We don’t need more Van Goghs any more than we need more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Elvis\">Elvises on velvet</a>. We may end up with a few fake Rembrandts where they shouldn’t be, but the art world will survive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If that’s the wrong question, what’s the right one? The problem with deepfakes is that simulating an artist’s style collided with the rise of fake news. Fake news isn’t new by any means; there have always been conspiracy theorists who are marvelously skeptical of “traditional” media, but are completely unskeptical of their own sources, whether they claim that Tibetans are spying on us through a system of underground tunnels or that vaccinations cause autism.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To this collision, add three more factors: the democratization of AI, the decrease in the cost of computing power, and the phenomenon of virality. Deepfakes jumped out of the lab and into the streets. You don’t need a Ph.D. to generate fake media, nor do you need the resources of a nation state to acquire enough computing power. Some easily available tools and a credit card to buy time on AWS are all you need. In some cases, it only takes an app: in China, a popular iPhone app <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns\">lets you put your face into movie clips</a>. (Ironically, backlash against this app didn’t take place because of the fakes but because of the app’s privacy policy.) Once you’ve created a fake, you can use social media to propagate it. YouTube’s and Facebook’s algorithms for optimizing “engagement” can make any content viral in seconds.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That all adds up to a scary picture. We will certainly see deepfakes in politics, though as security expert @thegrugq <a href=\"https://medium.com/@thegrugq/cheap-fakes-beat-deep-fakes-b1ac91e44837\">points out</a>, cheap fakes are better than deepfakes for shaping public opinion. Deepfakes might be more dangerous in computer security, where they can be used to circumvent authentication or perform high-quality phishing attacks. Symantec <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63cd4010-bfce-11e9-b350-db00d509634e\">has reported</a> that it has seen such attacks in the field, and recently an <a href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/04/an-artificial-intelligence-first-voice-mimicking-software-reportedly-used-major-theft/\">AI-generated voice that mimicked a CEO was used in a major fraud</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Deepfakes for good</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The scary story has been covered in many places, and it’s not necessary to repeat it here. What’s more interesting is to realize that deepfakes are just about high quality image generation. “Fakes” are a matter of context; they are specific applications of technologies for synthesizing video and other media. There are many contexts in which synthetic video can be used for good.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here are a few of these applications. <a href=\"https://www.synthesia.io/\">Synthesia</a> creates videos with translations, in which video is altered so that the speaker’s movements match the translation. It provides an easy way to create multilingual public service announcements that feel natural. You don’t have to find and film actors capable of getting your message across in many languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the biggest expenses in video games is creating compelling video. Landscapes are important, but so are dialog and facial expressions. Synthetic video is useful for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05509.pdf\">creating and animating Anime characters</a>; NVidia has used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18121198/ai-generated-video-game-graphics-nvidia-driving-demo-neurips\">create visuals</a> that can be used in video games.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many fields, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06222\">such as medicine</a>, in which collecting labeled training data is difficult. In one experiment, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10225\">synthetic MRI images showing brain cancers</a> were created to train neural networks to analyze MRIs. This technique has two advantages. First, cancer diagnoses are relatively rare, so it’s difficult to find enough images; and second, using synthetic images raises few privacy issues, if any. A large set of synthetic cancerous MRIs can be created from a small set of actual MRIs without compromising patient data because the synthetic MRIs don’t match any real person.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another medical application is creating synthetic voices for people who have lost the ability to speak. <a href=\"https://www.projectrevoice.org/#about\">Project Revoice</a> can create synthetic voices for ALS patients based on recordings of their own voice, rather than using mechanical-sounding synthetic voices. Remember hearing Stephen Hawking “speak” with his robotic computer-generated voice? That was state-of-the-art technology a few years ago. Revoice could give a patient their own voice back.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many online shopping sites are designed to make it easier to find clothes that you like and that fit. Deepfake technologies can be used to take images of customers and <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6644-pose-guided-person-image-generation.pdf\">edit in the clothing</a> they are looking at. The images could even be animated so they can see how an outfit moves as they walk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Policies and protections</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We will see a lot of fakes: some deep, some shallow, some innocuous, some serious. The more important question is what should be done about it. So far, social media companies have done little to detect and alert us to fakes, whether they are deep or shallow. Facebook has admitted that they were <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-26/facebook-ceo-company-was-too-slow-to-respond-to-pelosi-deepfake\">slow to detect a fake video of Nancy Pelosi</a>—and that video was an unsophisticated shallow fake. You could argue that any photoshopped picture is a “shallow fake,” and it isn’t hard to find social media “influencers” whose influence depends, in part, on Photoshop. Deepfakes will be even harder to detect. What role should social media companies such as Facebook and YouTube have in detecting and policing fakes?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Social media companies, not users, have the computing resources and the technical expertise needed to detect fakes. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613846/a-new-deepfake-detection-tool-should-keep-world-leaders-safefor-now/\">For the time being</a>, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-technical-societal-and-cultural-challenges-that-come-with-the-rise-of-fake-media?twitter=@bigdata\">the best detectors are</a> <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-twotrack-algorithm-to-detect-deepfake-images\">very hard to fool</a>. And Facebook has just announced the <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfake-detection-challenge/\">Deepfake Detection Challenge</a>, in partnership with Microsoft and a number of universities and research groups, to “catalyze more research and development” in detecting fakes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/12/top-ai-researchers-race-detect-deepfake-videos-we-are-outgunned/\">Hany Farid estimates </a>that people working on video synthesis outnumber people working on detection 100:1, but the ratio isn’t the real problem. The future of deepfake fraud will be similar to what we’ve already seen with cybersecurity, which is dominated by “script kiddies” who use tools developed by others, but who can’t generate their own exploits. Regardless of the sophistication of the tools, fakes coming from “fake kiddies” will be easily detectable, just because those tools are used so frequently. Any signatures they leave in the fakes will show up everywhere and be easily caught. That’s how we deal with email spam now: if spam were uncommon, it would be much harder to detect. It also wouldn’t be a problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In addition to the “fake kiddies,” there will be a small number of serious researchers who build the tools. They are a bigger concern. However, it’s not clear that they have an economic advantage. Media giants like Facebook and Google have the deep pockets needed to build state-of-the-art detection tools. They have practically unlimited computing resources, an army of researchers, and the ability to pay much more than a crooked advertising agency. The real problem is that media sites make more money from serving fake media than from blocking it; they emphasize convenience and speed over rigorous screening. And, given the number of posts that they screen, even a 0.1% false positive rate is going to create a lot of alerts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When fake detection tools are deployed, the time needed to detect a fake is important. Fake media does its damage almost instantly. Once a fake video has entered a social network, it will circulate indefinitely. Announcing after the fact that it is a fake does little good, and may even help the fake to propagate. Given the nature of virality, fakes have to be stopped before they’re allowed to circulate. And given the number of videos posted on social media, even with Facebook- or Google-like resources, responding quickly enough to stop a fake from propagating will be very difficult. We haven’t seen any data on the CPU resources required to detect fakes with the current technology, but researchers working on detection tools will need to take speed into account.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In addition to direct fake detection, it should be possible to use metadata to help detect and limit the spread of fakes. Renée DiResta has argued that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-return-of-fake-news/\">spam detection techniques</a> could work; and older <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/4/JCMC1048/4614533\">research</a> into <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume8/Welser/\">USENET</a> posting patterns has shown that it’s possible to identify the role users take using only metadata from their posts, not the content. While techniques like these won’t be the whole solution, they represent an important possibility: can we identify bad actors by the way they act, not the content they post? If we can, that would be a powerful tool.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since many fakes take the form of political advertisements, the organizations that run these advertisements must bear some accountability. Facebook is <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/ffe1c935a07344f7a94fb3352bc4a53c\">tightening up its requirements for political ads</a>, requiring tax ID numbers and other documentation, along with “paid for” disclaimers. These stricter requirements could still be spoofed, but they are an improvement. Facebook’s new rules go at least part way toward Edward Docx’s three <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/07/nick-clegg-facebook-fixer\">suggestions for </a><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/07/nick-clegg-facebook-fixer\">regulation</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><blockquote><p>Nobody should be allowed to advertise on social media during election campaigns unless strongly authenticated–with passports, certificates of company registration, declarations of ultimate beneficial ownership. The source and application of funds needs to be clear and easily visible. All ads should be recorded–as should the search terms used to target people.</p></blockquote></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The danger is that online advertising is searching for engagement and virality, and it’s much easier to maximize engagement metrics with faked extreme content. Media companies and their customers—the advertisers—must wean themselves from their addiction to the engagement habit. Docx’s suggestions would at least leave an audit trail, so it would be possible to reconstruct who showed which advertisement to whom. They don’t, however, address the bigger technical problem of detecting fakes in real time. We’d add a fourth suggestion: social media companies should not pass any video on to their consumers until it has been tested, even if that delays posting. While Facebook is obviously interested in tightening up authentication requirements, we doubt they will be interested in adding delays in the path between those who post video and their audiences.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is regulation a solution? Regulation brings its own problems. Regulators may not understand what they’re regulating adequately, leading to ineffective (or even harmful) regulation with easy technical workarounds. Regulators are likely to be unduly influenced by the companies they are regulating, who may suggest rules that sound good but don’t require them to change their practices. Compliance also places a bigger burden on new upstarts who want to compete with established media companies such as Facebook and Google.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Defending against disinformation</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What can individuals do against a technology that’s designed to confuse them? It’s an important question, regardless of whether some sort of regulation “saves the day.” It’s entirely too easy to imagine a dystopia where we’re surrounded by so many fakes that it’s impossible to tell what’s real. However, there are some basic steps you can take to become more aware of fakes and to prevent propagating them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps most important, never share or “like” content that you haven’t actually read or watched. Too many people pass along links to content they haven’t seen themselves. They’re going entirely by a clickbait title, and those titles are designed to be misleading. It’s also better to watch entire videos rather than short clips; watching the entire video gives context that you’d otherwise miss. It’s very easy to extract misleading video clips from larger pieces without creating a single frame of fake video!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When something goes viral, avoid piling on; virality is almost always harmful. Virality depends on getting thousands of people in a feedback loop of narcissistic self-validation that has almost nothing to do with the content itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important to use critical thinking; it’s also important to think critically about all your media, especially media that supports your point of view. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">Confirmation bias</a> is one of the most subtle and powerful ways of deceiving yourself. Skepticism is necessary, but it has to be applied evenly. It’s useful to compare sources and to rely on well-known facts. For example, if someone shares a video of “Boris Johnson in Thailand in June 2014” with you, you can dismiss the video without watching it because you know Boris was not in Thailand at that time. Strong claims require stronger evidence, and rejecting evidence because you don’t like what it implies is a great way to be taken in by fake media.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While most discussions of deepfakes have focused on social media consumption, they’re perhaps more dangerous in other forms of fraud, such as phishing. Defending yourself against this kind of fraud is not fundamentally difficult: use two factor authentication (2FA). Make sure there are other channels to verify any communication. If you receive voicemail asking you to do something, there should be an independent way to confirm that the message is genuine–perhaps by making a call back to a prearranged number. Don’t do anything simply because a voice tells you to. That voice may not be what you think it is.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you’re very observant, you can detect fakery in a video itself. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/detecting-deepfake-videos-in-the-blink-of-an-eye-101072\">Real people blink frequently, every 2 to 10 seconds</a>. Blinks are hard to simulate because synthetic video is usually derived from still photographs, and there are few photographs of people blinking. Therefore, people in fake video may not blink, or they may blink infrequently. There may be slight <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/how-to-spot-deepfake-videos.html\">errors in synchronization</a> between the sound and the video; do the lips match the words? Lighting and shadows may be off in subtle but noticeable ways. There may be other <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/detecting-deepfakes-by-looking-closely-reveals-a-way-to-protect-against-them-119218\">minor but detectable errors</a>: noses that don’t point in quite the right direction, distortions or blurred areas on an image that’s otherwise in focus, and the like. However, blinking, synchronization, and other cues show how quickly deepfakes are evolving. After the problem with blinking was publicized, the next generation of software <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18715235/deepfake-detection-ai-algorithms-accuracy-will-they-ever-work\">incorporated the ability to synthesize blinking</a>. That doesn’t mean these cues are useless; we can expect that many garden-variety fakes won’t be using the latest software. But the organizations building detection tools are in an escalating arms race with bad actors on technology’s leading edge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We don’t expect many people to inspect every video or audio clip they see in such detail. We do expect fakes to get better, we expect both deep and shallow fakes to proliferate, and we expect people to charge genuine video with being faked. After all, with fake news, the real goal isn’t to spread disinformation; it’s to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation#A_World_Without_Power\">nurture an attitude of suspicion and distrust</a>. If everything is under a cloud of suspicion, the bad actors win.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Therefore, we need to be wary and careful. Skepticism is useful–after all, it’s the basis for science–but denial isn’t skepticism. Some kind of regulation may help social media to come to terms with fakes, but it’s naive to pretend that regulating media will solve the problem. Better tools for detecting fakes will help, but exposing a fake frequently does little to change peoples’ minds, and we expect the ability to generate fakes will at least keep pace with the technology for detecting them. Detection may not be enough; the gap between the time a fake is posted and the time it’s detected may well be enough for disinformation to take hold and go viral.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Above all, though, we need to remember that creating fakes is an application, not a tool. The ability to synthesize video, audio, text, and other information sources can be used for good or ill. The creators of OpenAI’s powerful tool for creating fake texts <a href=\"https://go.technologyreview.com/openai-released-the-largest-version-of-gpt-2-yet\">concluded</a> that “after careful monitoring, they had not yet found any attempts of malicious use but had seen multiple beneficial applications, including in code autocompletion, grammar help, and developing question-answering systems for medical assistance.” Malicious applications are not the whole story. The question is whether we will change our own attitudes toward our information sources&nbsp; and become more informed, rather than less. Will we evolve into users of information who are more careful and aware? The fear is that fakes will evolve faster than we can; the hope is that we’ll grow beyond media that exists only to feed our fears and superstitions.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/9PQAmHRa6oA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Serverless adoption history among survey respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of those respondents whose organizations have adopted serverless, more than 50% made the jump one to three years ago, and 15% adopted serverless more than three years ago. Given that Amazon’s AWS Lambda functions are only five years old this November, anyone with more than three years of experience is a very early adopter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Approximately 30% of respondents have adopted serverless within the past year, and that is less than the over 50% who adopted serverless between one and three years ago. The gap may be due to respondents from major software companies and other technology-focused industries having explored serverless as an infrastructure option in its early days, and these organizations are historically faster to experiment with and adopt emerging paradigms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A related point: the rise of the serverless paradigm coincides with what we’ve referred to elsewhere as &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-is-next-architecture/\">Next Architecture</a>.&#8221; As the uncommitted respondents (again, 60%) grapple with issues surrounding the main components of Next Architecture—decomposition, containers, the cloud, and orchestration—serverless adoption would seem poised for considerable growth in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 6\" class=\"wp-image-9808\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure6.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 6. Rating of success of serverless adoption among survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More than two-thirds of respondents deemed their organizations’ adoption of serverless at least “mostly successful.” That overall pattern of success, at least for those respondents, shows that serverless has moved beyond a fad to become a substantive and viable infrastructure option. Stories of serverless success can help motivate non-adopters to more intensely evaluate how serverless might fit their infrastructure needs—the early adopters blazing a trail for those in more cautious organizations. We expect growing momentum for serverless, even as the challenges associated with adoption become more clear.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666-1048x550.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 7\" class=\"wp-image-9809\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666-1048x550.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666-300x158.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666-768x403.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure7-e1570028180666.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 7. Success rating of serverless adoption among survey respondents, broken down by serverless experience level.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The chart packs in a lot of data. A quick summary reveals that sophisticated respondents—i.e., those with three-plus years of serverless experience—show 79% mostly successful or better (17% extremely successful; 34% successful; 28% mostly successful); those early to serverless, i.e., with one-to-three years of experience, show 75% mostly successful or better (9% extremely successful; 32% successful, 34% mostly successful); and those new to the topic with less than a year of experience rate their implementations mostly successful or better 52% of the time (6% extremely successful, 29% successful, 17% mostly successful).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The contrast between organizations with the most and least time with serverless shows that experience appears to pay off. Serverless requires time and experience to resolve the tooling, data protection, and operational challenges that adopting serverless creates.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480-1048x613.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 8\" class=\"wp-image-9810\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480-1048x613.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480-300x176.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480-768x449.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure8-e1570028252480.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 8. Serverless benefits among survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked about the benefits of adopting serverless, there were some stand-out issues. “Reduction of operational costs” was the No. 1 reported benefit. Rather than buying racks and racks of servers that need to handle the maximum potential traffic and be idle most of the time, it seems that serverless’ method of paying by compute is proving to be beneficial to the bottom lines of organizations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This likely goes hand-in-hand with the second most popular reason for adoption: “scales with demand automatically.” Instead of planning for average or maximum usage, you can deploy serverless and it will scale to current usage. You only pay for what is used. This scaling takes away the worry from random and unexpected traffic spikes or big seasonal traffic.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The third stand-out issue was “no server maintenance.” As noted earlier, the majority of survey respondents are software engineers. These are not system administrators whose job it is to worry about keeping software patched, secured, and managed. When those details are the responsibility of the serverless provider, a software engineer&#8217;s time is freed up to focus on a wider range of tasks and roles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173-1048x540.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 9\" class=\"wp-image-9811\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173-1048x540.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173-300x155.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173-768x396.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure9-e1570028308173.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 9. Serverless benefits among survey respondents, broken down by serverless experience level.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we add experience level to the serverless benefit results (Figure 9), we see that “reduced engineering lead time” and “reduced development costs” were more significant benefits for companies that have been working with serverless for more than three years. This further reinforces that it takes time to start seeing significant cost benefits with serverless.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 10\" class=\"wp-image-9812\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure10.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 10. Serverless challenges faced by survey respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Educating current staff” was the No. 1 concern among respondents whose organizations have adopted serverless. That makes sense: with serverless being relatively young, formal training is difficult to find, specific documentation must be generated, and case studies to learn from—while growing—are harder to come by. In addition, organizations sometimes discover that success requires custom features. These features evolve quickly as vendors vigorously compete to attract and retain customers—making up-to-date formal training difficult to maintain.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The second biggest challenge was “vendor lock-in.” Writing code for one vendor platform does not make it portable or simple to move elsewhere. Because serverless is a nascent space, it seems the market is waiting to see how the issue of portability among vendors plays out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Integration/testing is harder” ranked as the third biggest worry, noted by 30% of respondents. Testing is more complex and labor intensive for serverless architectures, with more scenarios to address and different types of dependencies (e.g., latency, startup, mocking, etc.) changing the integration landscape—at least for now. We expect these testing issues to mostly resolve as serverless gains traction and new engineering practices that make testing easier emerge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The teams and tools that manage serverless</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 11\" class=\"wp-image-9813\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure11.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 11. Teams that manage serverless in survey respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DevOps and serverless seem a natural match, so it’s no surprise to see DevOps teams as the top choice among respondents for managing serverless implementations. Deploying containerized services on serverless architectures and orchestrating those services with Kubernetes fits into existing DeOps practices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That teams associated with software development hold the next three positions for managing serverless also makes sense. Serverless presents a conceptually simpler path to deploying software for those in development roles with no need to manage servers and storage. Not that serverless is simple: survey respondents note many challenges (see Figure 10), and those in software roles need to develop the chops required to deploy on serverless infrastructures—including knowing when those infrastructures are appropriate for their applications.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 12\" class=\"wp-image-9814\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure12.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 12.

Amazon’s early-to-market serverless offering and dominant market position has given them a functional leg up on their primary rivals in the cloud market. However, both Microsoft and Google have ramped up their own serverless offerings and likely retain whatever market differentiation they’ve already developed in the wider cloud market—i.e., customers who already like and use Azure or Google Cloud Platform are likely to find the same advantages hold with Azure Functions and Google Cloud Functions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 13\" class=\"wp-image-9815\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure13.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 13.

Reasons why survey respondents’ organizations have not adopted serverless.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Turning to the 60% of respondents whose organizations have not adopted serverless (Figure 4), they cited “security concerns” as the chief reason they have avoided serverless. Because we’re in an environment where security is a paramount concern, the adoption of any new technology carries a lot of weight. Moreover, serverless introduces a different paradigm for data management where sensitive data is much more dynamic. With valuable business data not being managed or controlled by your company, there will always be concerns around who has access, how safe is it, whether or not the vendor looks at the data or metadata, and whether or not the software is patched or vulnerable to attacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adjacent to security is also the challenge of meeting regulatory requirements like GDPR. In the cloud on third-party servers, can you guarantee the same levels of security and quality as your own on your own infrastructure?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15-1048x711.png\" alt=\"Serverless Survey figure 15\" class=\"wp-image-9817\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15-1048x711.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15-300x204.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15-768x521.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Figure15.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 15. When survey respondents expect their companies to implement serverless.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The high rate of survey participation shows the keen interest technologists have in the nascent, fast-moving ecosystem of serverless options, regardless of their own organization’s serverless plans. That respondents are paying close attention to serverless reflects a software architecture “best practice:” the need to understand every approach, even those that don’t apply.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The survey shows a cautious but curious world-wide cohort of engineers, tech leads, architects, and others from a variety of industries interested enough in serverless to respond to the survey. For the 40% who have taken the plunge into serverless adoption, we see that time and exposure bring success. And, those with the most serverless experience see that the promise of decreased costs, automatic scaling, and improved developer productivity holds as the top serverless benefits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet significant concerns exist, including training/upskilling existing staff, vendor lock-in, and the difficulties of integration and testing. Other factors blocking an embrace of serverless include concerns about security and managing this new type of infrastructure. And survey results show that these concerns do not go away even after adoption. It just seems that adopters have weighed the issues and determined the benefits of serverless adoption more than merit tolerating the drawbacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Based on the survey, we expect the demand for serverless to grow in the near term as another worthwhile infrastructure option for many organizations. With no ties to specific technologies or programming languages, serverless can work with a wide range of tasks, and getting started has gotten easier over time.</p>\\n\\n\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\\n<div id=\"_ftn1\">\\n<p><a href=\"#F1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The serverless adoption survey ran in June 2019.</p>\\n</div>\\n</aside><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Tpz60LEjmU4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

He describes the significance of a large project they&#8217;re wrapping up, move.mil. &#8220;Military service members have to move every two to four years, and the system that was enabling those moves was generally hostile toward the user experience. We&#8217;re working to use modern technologies to implement a new-and-improved system to schedule the moves to allow service members&#8217; spouses and family members to be active participants in figuring out how they&#8217;re going to uproot their lives and move across the country or around the world.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=2\">00:02</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>Recruiting is a challenge for any organization, but it&#8217;s particularly quirky for teams working with government organizations, Firth explains. He looks for folks who are not only at the top of their fields, but for those able to maneuver around the frustrations of slow-moving bureaucracy. &#8220;We have what we call core competencies&mdash;questions we ask and things we look for to determine whether or not someone&#8217;s going to be a good fit in our organization. &#8230; Some of those things that we call &#8217;emotional quotient&#8217; are as important if not more so than some of the technical quotient things we&#8217;re looking for. &#8230; We have to go through an enormous amount of validation of a person&#8217;s prior experiences, but then also a validation of them as a human. It gives us the ability to do the whole person concept, to make sure that, as we have a small team and we have to maintain a small team, we can work to make that small team work well together.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=57\">00:57</a>)\\n\\n<p>One might think it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult, Firth notes, but one of the main success metrics he uses is whether or not they can convince others that technology can make their lives better. Also in Firth&#8217;s case, the military leadership he deals with turns over every two to four years; all around, he&#8217;s on a &#8220;constant education campaign.&#8221; Firth outlines how he measures overall success: &#8220;Have we made the user&#8217;s life better? Have we used technology to do so in a way that appreciates (1) the capability of the technology, but also (2), the capability of the people who are implementing that technology and will have to do so long term? Then (3), have we walked away leaving behind us a legacy of creating that understanding of what technology could be used for?&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=198\">03:18</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/XeRPWuPwIDk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "    'value': '<p>In this interview from O&#8217;Reilly Foo Camp 2019, <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/\"><em>Programming Bitcoin</em></a> author Jimmy Song talks about why Bitcoin is a profound invention, the impact it&#8217;s already having on society, and its path to monetary relevance.</p>\\n\\n<p>Highlights from the interview include:</p>\\n\\n<p>In the physical world, we have centralized and decentralized scarcity—think numbered prints from artists (centralized) versus gold or salt or glass beads (decentralized). Until Bitcoin, Song argues, there was no decentralized scarcity in the digital realm. &#8220;Decentralized digital scarcity is a profound invention,&#8221; Song explains &#8220;because it lets you transfer value without an intermediary. There is no permission involved, there&#8217;s no censorability, and that makes it an excellent, excellent [form of] money.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=63\">1:03</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the tangible social impacts of Bitcoin can be witnessed in the human rights arena. As one example, Song offers an overview of the refugee crisis in Venezuela, explaining that Bitcoin is allowing those wishing to flee the country to sell their belongings and retain their money when crossing the border to Columbia. &#8220;There&#8217;s very clear evidence of this,&#8221; Song explains &#8220;because the price of Bitcoin in Columbia is actually lower than everywhere else in the world because there&#8217;s such a big supply. Four million Venezuelans have left. That&#8217;s 10% of their population. That&#8217;s a serious impact. Usually in refugee crises, it has gotten so bad that people were willing to leave everything behind. With this, they get to carry their wealth. It undermines the Maduro government to a large degree.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=351\">5:51</a>)</p> \\n\\n<p>The US&#8217;s market-driven monetary imperialism has led, Song argues, to a sort of global US dollar hegemony—the impact of which is that all global trade is settled in US dollars; if you&#8217;re in Kenya and want to trade with someone in neighboring Nigeria, you have to trade for the US dollar and then back to the Kenyan shilling. Song notes this basically gives the US dominance over everything and allows dictators, who control their economies through their central banks, to use money as a tool of oppression. &#8220;Bitcoin gives you a politically neutral money, one that&#8217;s not dominated by a single country. I say all this about the US dollar, but imagine a world where the Chinese yuan is the dominant currency.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=642\">10:42</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/ENi7moVeFTY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "    'value': '<p>Deepfakes have been very much in the news for the past two years. It’s time to think about what deepfakes are and what they mean. Where do they come from? Why now? Is this just a natural evolution in the history of technology?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deepfakes are media that are created by AI. They appear to be genuine (e.g., a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/17/17247334/ai-fake-news-video-barack-obama-jordan-peele-buzzfeed\">video of President Obama</a>) but have limited connection to reality. An audio track can be created that sounds indistinguishable from the victim, saying something the victim would never have said. Video can be generated from existing videos or photos that match the soundtrack, so that the mouth moves correctly and the facial expressions look natural. It’s not surprising that humans have trouble detecting fakes; with the current technology, even shallow fakes are too good.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deepfakes are the logical extension of older AI research. It wasn’t long ago that we read about AI generating new paintings in the style of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053520/ai-just-3d-printed-a-brand-new-rembrandt-and-its-shockingly-good.html\">Rembrandt</a> and other Dutch Masters, stylizing pictures in the style of <a href=\"https://qz.com/495614/computers-can-now-paint-like-van-gogh-and-picasso/\">Van Gogh and Picasso</a>, and so on. At the time, there was more concern about the future of human creativity: would we still need artists? Would we live in a world full of fake Van Goghs? We shrugged those “fakes” off because we were asking the wrong questions. We don’t need more Van Goghs any more than we need more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Elvis\">Elvises on velvet</a>. We may end up with a few fake Rembrandts where they shouldn’t be, but the art world will survive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If that’s the wrong question, what’s the right one? The problem with deepfakes is that simulating an artist’s style collided with the rise of fake news. Fake news isn’t new by any means; there have always been conspiracy theorists who are marvelously skeptical of “traditional” media, but are completely unskeptical of their own sources, whether they claim that Tibetans are spying on us through a system of underground tunnels or that vaccinations cause autism.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To this collision, add three more factors: the democratization of AI, the decrease in the cost of computing power, and the phenomenon of virality. Deepfakes jumped out of the lab and into the streets. You don’t need a Ph.D. to generate fake media, nor do you need the resources of a nation state to acquire enough computing power. Some easily available tools and a credit card to buy time on AWS are all you need. In some cases, it only takes an app: in China, a popular iPhone app <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns\">lets you put your face into movie clips</a>. (Ironically, backlash against this app didn’t take place because of the fakes but because of the app’s privacy policy.) Once you’ve created a fake, you can use social media to propagate it. YouTube’s and Facebook’s algorithms for optimizing “engagement” can make any content viral in seconds.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That all adds up to a scary picture. We will certainly see deepfakes in politics, though as security expert @thegrugq <a href=\"https://medium.com/@thegrugq/cheap-fakes-beat-deep-fakes-b1ac91e44837\">points out</a>, cheap fakes are better than deepfakes for shaping public opinion. Deepfakes might be more dangerous in computer security, where they can be used to circumvent authentication or perform high-quality phishing attacks. Symantec <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63cd4010-bfce-11e9-b350-db00d509634e\">has reported</a> that it has seen such attacks in the field, and recently an <a href=\"https://beta.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/04/an-artificial-intelligence-first-voice-mimicking-software-reportedly-used-major-theft/\">AI-generated voice that mimicked a CEO was used in a major fraud</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Deepfakes for good</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The scary story has been covered in many places, and it’s not necessary to repeat it here. What’s more interesting is to realize that deepfakes are just about high quality image generation. “Fakes” are a matter of context; they are specific applications of technologies for synthesizing video and other media. There are many contexts in which synthetic video can be used for good.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here are a few of these applications. <a href=\"https://www.synthesia.io/\">Synthesia</a> creates videos with translations, in which video is altered so that the speaker’s movements match the translation. It provides an easy way to create multilingual public service announcements that feel natural. You don’t have to find and film actors capable of getting your message across in many languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the biggest expenses in video games is creating compelling video. Landscapes are important, but so are dialog and facial expressions. Synthetic video is useful for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05509.pdf\">creating and animating Anime characters</a>; NVidia has used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18121198/ai-generated-video-game-graphics-nvidia-driving-demo-neurips\">create visuals</a> that can be used in video games.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many fields, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06222\">such as medicine</a>, in which collecting labeled training data is difficult. In one experiment, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10225\">synthetic MRI images showing brain cancers</a> were created to train neural networks to analyze MRIs. This technique has two advantages. First, cancer diagnoses are relatively rare, so it’s difficult to find enough images; and second, using synthetic images raises few privacy issues, if any. A large set of synthetic cancerous MRIs can be created from a small set of actual MRIs without compromising patient data because the synthetic MRIs don’t match any real person.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another medical application is creating synthetic voices for people who have lost the ability to speak. <a href=\"https://www.projectrevoice.org/#about\">Project Revoice</a> can create synthetic voices for ALS patients based on recordings of their own voice, rather than using mechanical-sounding synthetic voices. Remember hearing Stephen Hawking “speak” with his robotic computer-generated voice? That was state-of-the-art technology a few years ago. Revoice could give a patient their own voice back.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many online shopping sites are designed to make it easier to find clothes that you like and that fit. Deepfake technologies can be used to take images of customers and <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6644-pose-guided-person-image-generation.pdf\">edit in the clothing</a> they are looking at. The images could even be animated so they can see how an outfit moves as they walk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Policies and protections</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We will see a lot of fakes: some deep, some shallow, some innocuous, some serious. The more important question is what should be done about it. So far, social media companies have done little to detect and alert us to fakes, whether they are deep or shallow. Facebook has admitted that they were <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-26/facebook-ceo-company-was-too-slow-to-respond-to-pelosi-deepfake\">slow to detect a fake video of Nancy Pelosi</a>—and that video was an unsophisticated shallow fake. You could argue that any photoshopped picture is a “shallow fake,” and it isn’t hard to find social media “influencers” whose influence depends, in part, on Photoshop. Deepfakes will be even harder to detect. What role should social media companies such as Facebook and YouTube have in detecting and policing fakes?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Social media companies, not users, have the computing resources and the technical expertise needed to detect fakes. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613846/a-new-deepfake-detection-tool-should-keep-world-leaders-safefor-now/\">For the time being</a>, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-technical-societal-and-cultural-challenges-that-come-with-the-rise-of-fake-media?twitter=@bigdata\">the best detectors are</a> <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-twotrack-algorithm-to-detect-deepfake-images\">very hard to fool</a>. And Facebook has just announced the <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfake-detection-challenge/\">Deepfake Detection Challenge</a>, in partnership with Microsoft and a number of universities and research groups, to “catalyze more research and development” in detecting fakes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/12/top-ai-researchers-race-detect-deepfake-videos-we-are-outgunned/\">Hany Farid estimates </a>that people working on video synthesis outnumber people working on detection 100:1, but the ratio isn’t the real problem. The future of deepfake fraud will be similar to what we’ve already seen with cybersecurity, which is dominated by “script kiddies” who use tools developed by others, but who can’t generate their own exploits. Regardless of the sophistication of the tools, fakes coming from “fake kiddies” will be easily detectable, just because those tools are used so frequently. Any signatures they leave in the fakes will show up everywhere and be easily caught. That’s how we deal with email spam now: if spam were uncommon, it would be much harder to detect. It also wouldn’t be a problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In addition to the “fake kiddies,” there will be a small number of serious researchers who build the tools. They are a bigger concern. However, it’s not clear that they have an economic advantage. Media giants like Facebook and Google have the deep pockets needed to build state-of-the-art detection tools. They have practically unlimited computing resources, an army of researchers, and the ability to pay much more than a crooked advertising agency. The real problem is that media sites make more money from serving fake media than from blocking it; they emphasize convenience and speed over rigorous screening. And, given the number of posts that they screen, even a 0.1% false positive rate is going to create a lot of alerts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When fake detection tools are deployed, the time needed to detect a fake is important. Fake media does its damage almost instantly. Once a fake video has entered a social network, it will circulate indefinitely. Announcing after the fact that it is a fake does little good, and may even help the fake to propagate. Given the nature of virality, fakes have to be stopped before they’re allowed to circulate. And given the number of videos posted on social media, even with Facebook- or Google-like resources, responding quickly enough to stop a fake from propagating will be very difficult. We haven’t seen any data on the CPU resources required to detect fakes with the current technology, but researchers working on detection tools will need to take speed into account.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In addition to direct fake detection, it should be possible to use metadata to help detect and limit the spread of fakes. Renée DiResta has argued that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-return-of-fake-news/\">spam detection techniques</a> could work; and older <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/4/JCMC1048/4614533\">research</a> into <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume8/Welser/\">USENET</a> posting patterns has shown that it’s possible to identify the role users take using only metadata from their posts, not the content. While techniques like these won’t be the whole solution, they represent an important possibility: can we identify bad actors by the way they act, not the content they post? If we can, that would be a powerful tool.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since many fakes take the form of political advertisements, the organizations that run these advertisements must bear some accountability. Facebook is <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/ffe1c935a07344f7a94fb3352bc4a53c\">tightening up its requirements for political ads</a>, requiring tax ID numbers and other documentation, along with “paid for” disclaimers. These stricter requirements could still be spoofed, but they are an improvement. Facebook’s new rules go at least part way toward Edward Docx’s three <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/07/nick-clegg-facebook-fixer\">suggestions for </a><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2019/07/nick-clegg-facebook-fixer\">regulation</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><blockquote><p>Nobody should be allowed to advertise on social media during election campaigns unless strongly authenticated–with passports, certificates of company registration, declarations of ultimate beneficial ownership. The source and application of funds needs to be clear and easily visible. All ads should be recorded–as should the search terms used to target people.</p></blockquote></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The danger is that online advertising is searching for engagement and virality, and it’s much easier to maximize engagement metrics with faked extreme content. Media companies and their customers—the advertisers—must wean themselves from their addiction to the engagement habit. Docx’s suggestions would at least leave an audit trail, so it would be possible to reconstruct who showed which advertisement to whom. They don’t, however, address the bigger technical problem of detecting fakes in real time. We’d add a fourth suggestion: social media companies should not pass any video on to their consumers until it has been tested, even if that delays posting. While Facebook is obviously interested in tightening up authentication requirements, we doubt they will be interested in adding delays in the path between those who post video and their audiences.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is regulation a solution? Regulation brings its own problems. Regulators may not understand what they’re regulating adequately, leading to ineffective (or even harmful) regulation with easy technical workarounds. Regulators are likely to be unduly influenced by the companies they are regulating, who may suggest rules that sound good but don’t require them to change their practices. Compliance also places a bigger burden on new upstarts who want to compete with established media companies such as Facebook and Google.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Defending against disinformation</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What can individuals do against a technology that’s designed to confuse them? It’s an important question, regardless of whether some sort of regulation “saves the day.” It’s entirely too easy to imagine a dystopia where we’re surrounded by so many fakes that it’s impossible to tell what’s real. However, there are some basic steps you can take to become more aware of fakes and to prevent propagating them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps most important, never share or “like” content that you haven’t actually read or watched. Too many people pass along links to content they haven’t seen themselves. They’re going entirely by a clickbait title, and those titles are designed to be misleading. It’s also better to watch entire videos rather than short clips; watching the entire video gives context that you’d otherwise miss. It’s very easy to extract misleading video clips from larger pieces without creating a single frame of fake video!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When something goes viral, avoid piling on; virality is almost always harmful. Virality depends on getting thousands of people in a feedback loop of narcissistic self-validation that has almost nothing to do with the content itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important to use critical thinking; it’s also important to think critically about all your media, especially media that supports your point of view. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">Confirmation bias</a> is one of the most subtle and powerful ways of deceiving yourself. Skepticism is necessary, but it has to be applied evenly. It’s useful to compare sources and to rely on well-known facts. For example, if someone shares a video of “Boris Johnson in Thailand in June 2014” with you, you can dismiss the video without watching it because you know Boris was not in Thailand at that time. Strong claims require stronger evidence, and rejecting evidence because you don’t like what it implies is a great way to be taken in by fake media.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While most discussions of deepfakes have focused on social media consumption, they’re perhaps more dangerous in other forms of fraud, such as phishing. Defending yourself against this kind of fraud is not fundamentally difficult: use two factor authentication (2FA). Make sure there are other channels to verify any communication. If you receive voicemail asking you to do something, there should be an independent way to confirm that the message is genuine–perhaps by making a call back to a prearranged number. Don’t do anything simply because a voice tells you to. That voice may not be what you think it is.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you’re very observant, you can detect fakery in a video itself. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/detecting-deepfake-videos-in-the-blink-of-an-eye-101072\">Real people blink frequently, every 2 to 10 seconds</a>. Blinks are hard to simulate because synthetic video is usually derived from still photographs, and there are few photographs of people blinking. Therefore, people in fake video may not blink, or they may blink infrequently. There may be slight <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/how-to-spot-deepfake-videos.html\">errors in synchronization</a> between the sound and the video; do the lips match the words? Lighting and shadows may be off in subtle but noticeable ways. There may be other <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/detecting-deepfakes-by-looking-closely-reveals-a-way-to-protect-against-them-119218\">minor but detectable errors</a>: noses that don’t point in quite the right direction, distortions or blurred areas on an image that’s otherwise in focus, and the like. However, blinking, synchronization, and other cues show how quickly deepfakes are evolving. After the problem with blinking was publicized, the next generation of software <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18715235/deepfake-detection-ai-algorithms-accuracy-will-they-ever-work\">incorporated the ability to synthesize blinking</a>. That doesn’t mean these cues are useless; we can expect that many garden-variety fakes won’t be using the latest software. But the organizations building detection tools are in an escalating arms race with bad actors on technology’s leading edge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We don’t expect many people to inspect every video or audio clip they see in such detail. We do expect fakes to get better, we expect both deep and shallow fakes to proliferate, and we expect people to charge genuine video with being faked. After all, with fake news, the real goal isn’t to spread disinformation; it’s to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation#A_World_Without_Power\">nurture an attitude of suspicion and distrust</a>. If everything is under a cloud of suspicion, the bad actors win.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Therefore, we need to be wary and careful. Skepticism is useful–after all, it’s the basis for science–but denial isn’t skepticism. Some kind of regulation may help social media to come to terms with fakes, but it’s naive to pretend that regulating media will solve the problem. Better tools for detecting fakes will help, but exposing a fake frequently does little to change peoples’ minds, and we expect the ability to generate fakes will at least keep pace with the technology for detecting them. Detection may not be enough; the gap between the time a fake is posted and the time it’s detected may well be enough for disinformation to take hold and go viral.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Above all, though, we need to remember that creating fakes is an application, not a tool. The ability to synthesize video, audio, text, and other information sources can be used for good or ill. The creators of OpenAI’s powerful tool for creating fake texts <a href=\"https://go.technologyreview.com/openai-released-the-largest-version-of-gpt-2-yet\">concluded</a> that “after careful monitoring, they had not yet found any attempts of malicious use but had seen multiple beneficial applications, including in code autocompletion, grammar help, and developing question-answering systems for medical assistance.” Malicious applications are not the whole story. The question is whether we will change our own attitudes toward our information sources&nbsp; and become more informed, rather than less. Will we evolve into users of information who are more careful and aware? The fear is that fakes will evolve faster than we can; the hope is that we’ll grow beyond media that exists only to feed our fears and superstitions.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/9PQAmHRa6oA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",
